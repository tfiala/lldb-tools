"""This script builds the lldb executable(s).

Usage:  lldb_mklog.py  [--filter]  { <make-args> ... }

It runs make with the given arguments, and sending the output both to
stdout of this script and to "make.log" in the current directory.

If --filter is specified (it must be the first argument), the output
is filtered to remove gcc warnings emitted about %p not matching void*,
and an additional file "make-unfiltered.log" is also created in the
current directory

Run this script from a 'build' directory outside of the llvm/../lldb
tree to keep generated files out of the source tree.
